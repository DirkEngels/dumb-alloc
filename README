"A sketch of a basic OO memory allocator with malloc/free wrapper functions"

This is a project for exploring ideas about memory allocation for C.

I would like to be able to:
* allocate memory dynamically from the OS
* return unused memory to the OS
* support special-purpose allocators e.g. allocator-per-tab

It will be fun to bring this to a point that it could be used as an
alternative to malloc/free, however there is no goal of competing
with existing implementations. Please do not confuse this with
something intended to be useful for anything other than experimentation,
self-education, and fun.
